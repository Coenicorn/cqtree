# Static library

This is the static library for this implementation.

If you WANT to use this, what are you doing, honestly, but you can link with the libqtree.a file (-lqtree as demonstrated in ../example/Makefile). You can #include the header file, it shouldn't be missing anything.

There are no external dependencies, so apart from -lqtree, no other compiler flags!
