### Example usage

This example uses the Raylib library, hope this helps anyone mad enough to actually use this thing lol

Relevant commands (in dir (...)/cqtree/example):

To build:

```
make
```

To run (assuming you've built first):
```
build/main.out
```

**Note: To build there needs to be a directory "build" present in (...)/cqtree/example, this isn't included in github so you'll need to create that, either through running:**

```
mkdir build
```

**in dir (...)/cqtree/example or just through the gui for you fancy os users ;)**
