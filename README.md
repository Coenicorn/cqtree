### Quad Tree in C

This is my implementation of a quad tree in C.

It's not that good, but it's mine, so I like it...

I really don't recommend using this (though it does have a static library in lib_files), cuz I don't know if it's memory safe
at all, but I use it myself sometimes so I guess you could lol.

Relevant commands (in dir (...)/cqtree/):

To build:

```
make
```

To run:

```
build/main.out
```

**Note: To build there needs to be a directory "build" present in (...)/cqtree, this isn't included in github so you'll need to create that, either through running:**

```
mkdir build
```

**in dir (...)/cqtree or just through the gui for you fancy os users ;)**
