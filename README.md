### Quad Tree in C

This is my implementation of a quad tree in C.

It's not that good, but it's mine, so I like it...

I really don't recommend using this (though it does have a static library in lib_files), cuz I don't know if it's memory safe
at all, but I use it myself sometimes so I guess you could lol.
